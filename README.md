# MSCS532_Assignment1

This repository contains an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm (descending order) for the MSCS532 Assignment 1.

**Contents**

- `insertion_sort_desc_algorithm.py`: Python implementation of insertion sort that sorts a list in descending order.

**Description**

The provided script demonstrates the insertion sort algorithm applied to an array of numbers, producing a sorted sequence in descending order. Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time and is efficient for small or nearly-sorted datasets. The user can input any array with commas or spaces, and get a sorted array in descending order as output.

**Usage**

Run the script with Python 3:

```bash
python3 insertion_sort_desc_algorithm.py
```

If you want to import the sorting function into another script, open `insertion_sort_desc_algorithm.py` and call the provided function (or adapt the example main section).

**Algorithm Complexity**

- Worst-case time complexity: $O(n^2)$
- Best-case time complexity: $O(n)$ (when input is already sorted in descending order)
- Space complexity: $O(1)$ (in-place)

**Author**

- Created for MSCS532 Assignment 1.

This repository is provided as-is for coursework.
